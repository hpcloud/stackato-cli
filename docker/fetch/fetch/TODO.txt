[..] (1)
	Switch over to cmdr 1 for the cli API.

	- Heavy rewrite of internals, notably option definition and
	  use to get away from shared options.

[OK] (1a)
	Store a copy of cmdr framework in the project, to break
	installation cycle.

	Without: Kettle install requires Cmdr requires Kettle.

[OK] (2)
	Better integration of the project mgmt features/commands.
	No special cli code anymore.

[..] (2a)
	Internal validation types for
	- available licenses
	- available requirements text blocks
	- available DSL commands

[..] (2b)
	Extend 'requirements set' to detect removed requirements,
	and remove their files as well.

[..] (4)
	Command(s) to scan a directory and classify the files in it,
	for setting up the build.tcl file:

	- Tcl packages
	- Critcl packages
	- Documentation
	- Testsuites
	- Benchmarks
	- Tcl applications
	- Files to Ignore

	This classification should detect variety of files in the
	above classes even when not marked properly, i.e. missing the
	proper magic strings.

[..] (5)
	An outgrowth of (4), validation of the project, i.e. checking
	it against various rules (must have docs, tests, should have
	benchmarks) and other external tools, like tclchecker,
	nagelfar, frink, etc.

[..] (6)
	Command history

[..] (7)
	Always generate the testsuite X.* files, store results in the
	project, as files ignored by default.

	New commands to query this database.

[..] (8)
	Ditto for benchmarks.

[..] (9)
	Helper commands to generate testsuite and benchmark skeletons
	from templates.

[..] (10)
	Helper commands for easy generation of a new requirements and
	license blocks. Stored directly into project, or in a local
	folder Kettle uses for extension information.

[..] (10a)
	Helper commands to maintain a web database of kettle extensions.
	(transfer local extensions to global and vice versa)
