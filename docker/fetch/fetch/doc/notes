task:	write docs for all the commands
	starting with user commands and working
	down the layers

todo: 	Extend recipe definitions with flags the gui can use to
      	determine sort order, and the set it should not show ...
	... A category string/tag? Allows grouping of other
	recipes also.

options:	document the use cases and implementation
		- user/default - 2-level priority
		- need 3rd for override (invoke)?
		- works without, because o-processing ordered.

note:	no need for hooks to define local kettle recipes and support!
	=> use source and existing commands. example:

		source [path sourcedir mydefinitions.tcl]

task:	gui use separators for button groups
	what to do when list of recipes = buttons way to large?

task:	auto show the used options and values in log
	when running a recipe.



idea:	recognize doxygen annotations, call on doxygen

task:	integration of tclchecker usage, naglefar, and others
	code validation -> tcl packages only.

task:	critcl support - drop support: remove installed headers

	recipe 'uninstall-headers'
	- has to get info from critcl, or do blind based on package name ...
	- scan critcl files for specific commands ?

task:	tcllib sak - more integration
	- generate distribution
	- generate teabags (teapot ready archive files)

future:	rework internals to break the cycles between layers
	(options <-> path, some others)

idea:	tests, multi-shell support.
task:	options - specify accumulative options (--with-shell)

idea:	'kettle tea' command. integrates a configure/make structure
	into kettle.

use kettle for
	tclyaml, crimp, critcl, kinetcl
